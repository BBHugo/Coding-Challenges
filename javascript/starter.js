//This code is to help replace certain parts of a string with whatever you want

  //the g means global to replace more than just the first find in the string, and the i is for case sensitivity

//A ternary example to use later on, this one returns health - damage, but can't fall below 0
const combat = (health,damage) =>  health - damage > 0 ? health - damage : 0
  //Tried it with curly braces following the arrow but didn't work. Works this way though.
