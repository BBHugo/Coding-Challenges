//Code to return the amount of vowels in a string

    //ï‚§	Explanation: For anyone curious about what the "ig" portion of the .match argument does (as I was), it turns out "i" and "g" are both one of five optional "flags" that can be used in connection with regular expressions. The "g" makes it so the regex search is global (i.e., all matches in a string are returned, as opposed to a single match) and the "i" makes it so the search is case-insensitive.

//Giving each string in an array a consecutive number starting at 1: . Ex: [a,b,c] = ['1: a', '2: b', '3: c']

//method 1:
function number(array){
    let arrayNum = []
    array.forEach((x,i) => {
        let numbering = i + 1
        arrayNum.push(numbering + ": " + x)

}

//Dryer Method:
function number(array){
    return array.map(function(line, index){
        return (index + 1) + ": " + line
    })
}

    //Used the map method to create a function that imitated method 1 code by adding all of the end result together but it didn't require the first vairable. using line as the x and index as i respectively

//An example of using the typeof syntax in a conditional to determine if an element in an array is a string
function filter_list(l) {
    let nums = []
    l.forEach((x,i) => {

//A useful way to filter out an array to only include the things we want, in this case we are looking for strings that are exactly 4 in length.

  //Essentially, it does the same as the code below

            fourFriends.push(x)

//The below is code to help us turn an array of binary to decimal
const binaryArrayToNumber = arr => parseInt(arr.join(''), 2) // We have to first join the array within the parseInt parameter.

//The below code is useful for finding characteristics within a string using the .match method
function XO(str) {

  //A problem I had before was, if we try to do the .length into to the original variable, null will prevent our .length from reading. So adding the o & x variables to the conditional works great

//Below is a smart way to use the .split() method to separate a string by an anything within a string and returning everything before it. This strings purpose is to return everything before '#' and remove everything after. example: www.helloWorld.com/KeepMe#removeme -> www.helloWorld.com/KeepMe

function sumOfMinimums(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((p, c) => p + Math.min(...c), 0);
} //The "..." within the reduce method's operation is a "rest operator" used to grab the different arrays within the single parameter of "arr" (This might be wrong but is my understanding)
